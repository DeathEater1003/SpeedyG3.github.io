            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a>
            with attributes of wild species such as grey and ceylon
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a><sup><a href="link.com">[1]</a></sup>
            that
            are originally from Southeastern
            Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
            that
            has
            been castratedis a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a
            pullet.
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
            (consuming both
            their meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
            a
            total population of 23.7 billion as
            of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird.[5]
            There are numerous culturalreferences to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
            literature.
        </p>

        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6]
            but
            the
            clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
            From
            ancient India,
            the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been
            known
            in
            Egypt since
            the mid-15th century BC, with the "birdthat gives birth every day" having come from the land betweenSyria
            and
            Shinar, Babylonia,
            according to the annals of ThutmoseIII.[8][9][10]

        <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
        <p>
            Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects,
            and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.
            Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
            pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder
            colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken,
            the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can
            be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs
            (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour).
            Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin
            either side under their beaks called wattles.
        </p>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>
            Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
            of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking
            order',
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters
            from
            a
            flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
            hens,
            especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.
